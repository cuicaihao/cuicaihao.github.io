# cuicaihao.github.io

This repository houses the source code for my personal website, built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator and the [PaperMod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/) theme.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to create a backup site for my existing WordPress blog, [cuicaihao.com](https://cuicaihao.com/).  Additionally, this site will serve as a platform for enhanced content presentation, particularly when featuring large code blocks that are better suited for a static site environment.

## Technologies Used

*   **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/):** A fast and flexible static site generator written in Go.  Hugo is known for its speed, ease of use, and powerful templating system.
*   **[PaperMod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/):** A clean and customizable Hugo theme focused on performance and readability.  PaperMod offers a variety of features, including light/dark mode, SEO optimization, and social sharing options.

## Key Features (Planned)

*   **WordPress Blog Backup:**  Regularly updated mirror of content from [cuicaihao.com](https://cuicaihao.com/).
*   **Enhanced Code Block Presentation:** Improved formatting and display of code snippets compared to the WordPress blog.
*   **Fast Loading Times:** Leveraging Hugo's static site generation for optimal performance.
*   **Responsive Design:** Ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.

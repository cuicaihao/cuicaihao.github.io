## Featured üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Open Source Project

[SplitRaster](https://pypi.org/project/splitraster/) is a Python Package to split a large image into small tiles. It is useful for deep learning and computer vision tasks. The package can also be used to split a large image into small tiles with geo-information embedded, like `tif`, `tiff`. 
  - Github: https://github.com/cuicaihao/split_raster
  - Pypi: https://pypi.org/project/splitraster/
  - Tutorial with Docs:  https://cuicaihao.github.io/split_raster/



## ü§î 2025 Goals

  - [ ] Keep being role model and targeting the top 10% in Teams.
  - [ ] Keep supporting academic communities by offering feedbacks as reviewer and associate editor, please send review invitation to **caihao.cui[at]ieee.org**.
  - [ ] Keep writing my blogs of technology or algorithm applications on my website.
  - [ ] Publish one paper on academic journals in 2025 on AI application in industry.
  - [ ] Contribute more to the Deep Learning Open Source projects ([TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow), [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch) and [PaddleX](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle)).
